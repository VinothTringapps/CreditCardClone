// 3. Design a class for a basic credit card. The class should have the following features:
//    - Instance variables for the cardholder's name, card number, and expiration date.
//        - A constructor that allows the user to create a credit card with a given name, card number, and expiration date.
//        - An equals method that returns true if the given object is a credit card with the same card number, and false otherwise.
//        - A clone method that creates and returns a new credit card with the same name, card number, and expiration date as the original credit card."
